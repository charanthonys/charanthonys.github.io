        <centering><h1> Some basic questions with there answer/fix</h1><br></br>
        <h1>Q:How do I mod Lethal Compay?</h1><br></br>
    <p>A: Simple answer you can follow the directions a mod has to offer usally in a read me can be as simple as moving
        the mod files to the correct file location in the lethal company game folder. Or getting a mod organizer/launcher 
        like Thunderstore.</p><br></br>
    <h1>Q: What is Thunderstore?</h1><br></br>
    <p>A: It is a mod manager used for various supported games. (for more info a simple google search)</p></centering><br></br>
    <h1>Q: Can I play vanilla with mods?</h1><br></br>
    <p>A: Yes, but its complicated if a mod explicitly states that other uses must have the mod then you cannot, however some 
        client side mods will work in vanilla (mods that will only effect your game without intrupting other peoples game) </p><br></br>
    <h1>Q: I keep crashing after trying to install some mods</h1><br></br>
    <p>THere is no simple answer for this the best practice is to install non known working mods and find the mod that produces
        the crash and try to fix it seperatly.</p><br></br>
        <h1>Q: What are mod packs?</h1><br></br>
        <p>A: Mod packs are a collections of mods that have been tested to work together. (note if the mod pack is not
            maintained it may stop working on later updates of the base game).
